# CraftEssence

Welcome to **CraftEssence** - A module-based core plugin, specifically designed for Minecraft servers with a primary aim - *to eliminate server bloat and offer a simple, flexible foundation for developers*.

## **The Essence of CraftEssence**

The purpose of CraftEssence is to deliver a modern, efficient alternative to feature-heavy plugins. We are here to break the cycle of performance cost, complexity and limited customizations in return for providing solutions to each server need.

What sets CraftEssence apart is its modularity, which enables server administrators to pick and choose features, thus reducing unnecessary resource consumption. The essence lies in getting what you need!

### Community & Custom Essences
