# CraftEssence

**CraftEssence** is a module-based core plugin designed for Minecraft servers. The main goal of CraftEssence is to provide a lightweight framework that eliminates server bloat caused by plugins like CMI or Essentials, while offering a simple, flexible foundation for developers to create new or maintain existing plugins with ease.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: CraftEssence is built around a core that allows for plugins (called *Essences*) to be added or removed without bloating the server with unnecessary features.
- **Official Essences**: Officially supported add-ons are referred to as *Essences*, providing core functionalities that server owners can easily enable.
- **Community & Custom Essences**: Public or third-party Essences can be named anything and extend the functionality of the core plugin with ease.
- **Developer-Friendly Framework**: Aimed at both new and experienced developers, CraftEssence offers a simplified, streamlined API to create robust server plugins without dealing with performance or feature creep.

## Why CraftEssence?

The purpose of CraftEssence is to provide a modern, efficient alternative to feature-heavy plugins. While many all-in-one plugins attempt to provide solutions to every possible server need, they often come at the cost of performance, complexity, and customization. CraftEssence embraces modularity, allowing server administrators to pick and choose the exact features they need, reducing unnecessary resource consumption.

## Getting Started

1. Download and install the **CraftEssence** core.
2. Choose from a selection of *Essences* or create your own using the developer-friendly API.
3. Add or remove Essences as needed to suit your server's requirements.

## Creating an Essence

Developers can easily create and share their own Essences by following the guidelines in the provided API documentation. Whether youâ€™re building a custom feature or enhancing existing server functionality, the framework ensures clean integration without server clutter.

## Contributing

Contributions to the project are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests for improvements, optimizations, or new Essences. The goal of CraftEssence is to build a lightweight yet highly customizable ecosystem for Minecraft servers.
